# Diagonal Sum of a Binary Tree

## Problem

Consider lines of slope -1 passing through the nodes in the given binary tree. Assume that the child of any given node makes a 45 degree angle with the parent. Print the diagonal sums of the elements belonging to the same line in a binary tree.

## Review

After exploring the usefulness of a diagonal traversal in order to calculate the diagonal sum of a binary tree, are there any other binary tree traversals that could be used in this manner and how would they be used?
