## Problem

Based on the design of the Dutch national flag, as depicted above, which consists of three horizontal strips: red, white, and blue. Initially, think of having an assortment of balls in these three colors â€“ the exact number is immaterial. The goal is to organize these balls into groups based on color, and then order the groups to match the flag.Now, apply the same concept to three different numbers, given in any order, and sort into ascending order.

```
Given {2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3}, sort into {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4}

Given {5, 1, 7, 7, 1, 5, 5, 1, 7, 1}, sort into {1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7}
```

The process is the same regardless of what the three numbers areand how many of each there is.

**Check-in:** Given {3, 9, 9, 12, 3, 12, 12, 12, 9, 3, 9}, what should you return?
