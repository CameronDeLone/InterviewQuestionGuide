## Adding to the Repo

First, use the **Fork** button to create your own copy of the repo. In Git, a fork is like a branch of the project. You are free to make 
any changes you want to your fork, which can then be integrated back into the "master" repository.

Once you have your fork, create a new file to hold your problem tutorial. Give your new file a descriptive name and place it in the 
appropriate topic directory. **All files you create will have a Markdown (.md) extension**.

Edit the file using Markdown syntax. You can save it as you go using the "Commit" button within the GitHub user interface. You can edit and commit as many times as you want until you have the file complete and formatted the way you want it.

Once your new file is complete, create a Pull Request. This action sends a notification to me, as the owner of the master repository,
that there are changes in your fork that you would like to have merged into the master. For the most part, creating the pull request is
straightforward: include a descriptive comment with your request explaining what file you're adding. I'll have the opportunity to review
your changes before I accept them.
